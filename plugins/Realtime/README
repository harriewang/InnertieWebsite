As of StatusNet 1.0.x, actual formatting of the notices is done server-side,
loaded by AJAX after the real-time notification comes in. This has the drawback
that we may make extra HTTP requests and delay incoming notices a little, but
means that formatting and internationalization is consistent.

== TODO ==
* Update mark behaviour (on notice send)
* Pause, Send a notice ~ should not update counter
* Pause ~ retain up to 50-100 most recent notices
* Make it work for Conversation page (perhaps a little tricky)
* IE is updating the counter in document title all the time (Not sure if this
  is still an issue)
* Reconsider the timestamp approach
